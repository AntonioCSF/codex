# Missing user funcionality

* Allow restricting visible pages by user (page prefixes)
* Allow getting events from Database

# Missing admin functionalty

* no user-friendly interface to add/remove user roles (e.g. administrator)
* no way to create files (other than by uploading)
X no way to delete submissions - DONE
* no way to change classifications/timing of submissions
X implement export submissions (e.g. CSV) - DONE
* implement printout submissions

# Known bugs

* re-submiting exercises as admin does not maintain the original user id
* possible security flaw: all files types (including specifications,
  solutions, etc) are served by the public interface
