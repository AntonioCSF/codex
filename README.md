# Codex

*Codex* is a web application for setting programming exercises in a learning environment (e.g. programming classes). 

## Features

* allows flexible Markdown "wiki"-style mix of documentation and exercises
* allows testing single units rather than complete programs (e.g. functions)
* it can provide automatic feedback (failed test cases)
* supports Python (using doctests), and Haskell (using QuickCheck); C is also suported using the Haskell FFI
